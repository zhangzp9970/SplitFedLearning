# SplitFedLearning

A split federated learning demo with Pytorch

Two clients and a server was implemented.

The [training-based Model Inversion Attack (MIA)](https://doi.org/10.1145/3319535.3354261) is implemented.

## Usage

Install Pytorch >=1.8.1 and [torchplus](https://github.com/zhangzp9970/torchplus)

Run main.py to train the classifier using split federated learning.

Run attack.py to perform MIA.

Run export.py to export both the private images and auxiliary images.
